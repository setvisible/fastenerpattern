/*! \mainpage FastenerPattern
 *
 * FastenerPattern is a solution for designing fastener patterns
 * (i.e. *bolted* and *riveted* joints) in Aerostructures,
 * for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.
 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 *
 * Its core is developed in C++, based on the Qt framework.
 * It uses the Boost::Units module.
 *

 *
 * \section analysis Dimensional Analysis
 *
 * Dimensional Analysis is the analysis of relationships between different
 * physical quantities by identifying their fundamental dimensions.
 *
 * FastenerPattern uses the Dimensional Analysis abilities of the Boost::Units module
 * to verify the dimensional homogeneity of the mechanical quantities and formulas used by the software.
 *
 * This enables a better Verification & Validation, since the code is more robust (less permissive) and more reliable.
